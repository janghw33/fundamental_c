Each top-level folder contains a single PDF with several assignments. 
Solutions to each assignment are implemented in folders named ex+number corresponding to each task. 
The Shell folder contains projects related to the Linux environment, file system management, etc. 
Inside the C private folder, there are projects that range from 
basic to implementing important C library functions and complex algorithm implementations.
